## 6. Conclusion

### 6.1. Summary of Key Findings

This paper has systematically explored the transformative impact of agentic architectures within the emerging paradigm of AI-native software development. Our review of current literature highlights that autonomous AI agents are becoming pivotal players across the software development lifecycle, significantly enhancing productivity through intelligent automation of tasks such as code generation, testing, and architectural exploration. We identified that leading agentic AI frameworks share core architectural principles emphasizing modularity, robust communication, and adaptive behaviors. Crucially, the research underscores the persistent challenge of the "speed vs. trust" gap, emphasizing the need for advanced verification mechanisms and transparent agent reasoning to ensure the trustworthiness of AI-generated artifacts.

### 6.2. Reaffirmation of Thesis

The central thesis that agentic architectures are fundamentally reshaping AI-native software development, offering both unprecedented opportunities for efficiency and significant challenges in ensuring reliability and trustworthiness, has been reaffirmed. The evolving collaboration between humans and AI agents, where humans provide high-level guidance and agents execute detailed tasks, signifies a profound shift in software engineering practices. This symbiotic relationship, if properly managed with robust V&V and ethical considerations, promises to unlock new frontiers in software innovation and system adaptability.

### 6.3. Contributions of the Research

This research makes several key contributions. Firstly, it provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state of agentic architectures in AI-native software development, consolidating disparate findings into a coherent framework. Secondly, it critically analyzes the "speed vs. trust" gap, offering insights into the multifaceted challenges of ensuring trustworthiness and verifiability. Thirdly, the paper delineates the implications for software architecture, human-agent collaboration paradigms, and the evolving skill sets required for future developers. Finally, it outlines essential ethical considerations and practical implications for organizations aiming to integrate agentic systems, thereby guiding responsible adoption and future research.

### 6.4. Future Research Directions

Building upon these findings, several avenues for future research emerge. Further empirical studies are needed to evaluate the real-world performance and scalability of various agentic AI frameworks in industrial settings. Research into novel AI-based verification and validation techniques specifically designed for autonomous agents, including formal methods and runtime monitoring, is paramount to bridge the "speed vs. trust" gap. Investigating the long-term impact of human-agent collaboration on developer skill evolution and job roles also warrants deeper exploration. Additionally, developing robust ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks for agent-generated code, particularly in safety-critical applications, remains a crucial area of inquiry to ensure the responsible and beneficial deployment of AI-native software development.
