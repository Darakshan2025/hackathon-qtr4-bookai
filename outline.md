# Research Paper: Agentic Architectures in AI-Native Software Development

## Abstract Sketch
This paper explores the emerging field of AI-native software development, focusing on the pivotal role of agentic architectures. We examine how autonomous AI agents are transforming various stages of the software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis to deployment and maintenance. Through a systematic review of recent peer-reviewed literature, we analyze the architectural principles, communication protocols, and design challenges of leading agentic AI frameworks. We also investigate the impact of these architectures on software engineering productivity, trustworthiness, and the evolving human-agent collaboration paradigm. The paper identifies key opportunities and challenges, proposing a research roadmap for structured agentic software engineering and outlining implications for future AI-native systems. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the foundational pillars necessary for building intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents, ultimately aiming to bridge the 'speed vs. trust' gap in agent-generated code.
