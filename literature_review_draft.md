## 2. Literature Review: Agentic AI in Software Engineering

### 2.1. Defining Agentic AI and its Evolution

Agentic AI represents a significant evolution in artificial intelligence, moving beyond static, rule-based systems to dynamic, autonomous entities capable of goal-oriented behavior within complex environments (Derouiche et al., 2025). Historically, AI in software development saw early applications in expert systems and automated theorem proving, aiming to formalize and automate specific, well-defined tasks. These early attempts, while foundational, often lacked the adaptability and generalized intelligence required for broader software engineering challenges. The modern era of AI agents, largely propelled by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), has transformed this landscape. LLM-driven agents are endowed with enhanced natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities, enabling them to interpret complex instructions, strategize multi-step solutions, and interact with diverse tools and environments (arXiv:2508.11126).

### 2.2. Foundational Pillars of Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0)

Roychoudhury (2025) introduces "Agentic Software Engineering (SE 3.0)" as a new paradigm where intelligent agents are fundamental to achieving complex software engineering objectives. This vision posits a duality: "SE for Humans" and "SE for Agents." SE for Humans focuses on traditional developer workflows, albeit augmented by sophisticated AI tools, while SE for Agents centers on designing and managing autonomous agents that perform development tasks directly. This framework also proposes an "Agent Command Environment (ACE)" for human orchestration and mentorship of agent teams, and an "Agent Execution Environment (AEE)" where agents operate independently, seeking human expertise when necessary. This structured approach aims to bridge the gap between human intention and agent execution, fostering a more harmonious and efficient development ecosystem.

### 2.3. Architectures, Protocols, and Design Challenges in Agentic AI Frameworks

The architectural landscape of agentic AI frameworks is rapidly evolving, with systems like CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and MetaGPT demonstrating diverse approaches to agent coordination and task execution (Derouiche et al., 2025). A comparative analysis reveals common architectural principles that prioritize modularity, extensibility, and robust communication. Key components typically include a planning module (for decomposing tasks), a memory system (for retaining context), a tool integration layer (for interacting with external APIs and systems), and an execution monitor (for overseeing agent actions). Communication mechanisms are crucial for multi-agent systems, often employing protocols like the Contract Net Protocol (CNP) or custom Agent-to-Agent (A2A) interfaces to facilitate collaboration and information exchange. Design challenges include ensuring effective memory management for long-context understanding, developing resilient safety protocols to prevent unintended behaviors, and achieving seamless interoperability between heterogeneous agents and tools.

### 2.4. Techniques, Challenges, and Opportunities in AI Agentic Programming

AI agentic programming, as surveyed by arXiv:2508.11126, encompasses a broad array of techniques for building intelligent coding agents. A taxonomy of agent behaviors highlights capabilities such as self-correction, iterative refinement, and goal-driven problem-solving. Core techniques involve advanced planning algorithms that enable agents to break down high-level objectives into actionable steps, sophisticated context management to maintain coherence across extended interactions, and robust tool integration to leverage existing software development utilities (e.g., compilers, debuggers, version control systems). Despite these advancements, significant challenges persist, including limitations in handling very long and complex contexts, the absence of persistent memory across distinct tasks, and critical concerns regarding the safety, alignment, and ethical implications of autonomous AI agents. Opportunities lie in improving agent reliability, enhancing their adaptability to novel problem domains, and increasing the transparency and interpretability of their decision-making processes.

### 2.5. Agentic AI for Software Tasks: Code Generation, Testing, Program Repair, and Architecture Exploration

Agentic AI is poised to transform various specialized software engineering tasks. Beyond basic code generation, agents can autonomously engage in more complex activities. For instance, in testing, AI agents can dynamically generate test cases, execute them, and even interpret results to identify subtle bugs. For program repair, agents can analyze error logs, diagnose root causes, and propose corrective code patches. In the realm of architecture, agents can explore design alternatives, evaluate trade-offs, and suggest optimal system configurations based on performance or scalability requirements (Roychoudhury, 2025). The ability of agents to infer developer intent and make micro-decisions across these tasks underscores their potential to significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of software development workflows.

### 2.6. Role of Agentic AI in Next-Generation Wireless Networks

The integration of agentic AI extends beyond conventional software development into specialized domains like next-generation wireless networks (Dev et al., 2025). In these complex environments, agentic AI is being leveraged to simplify network operations, optimize resource allocation, and enable new service models. AI agents can perform real-time learning, dynamically adapt network configurations, and manage energy consumption in intricate 6G architectures. This application demonstrates the versatility of agentic architectures in tackling critical operational challenges, enhancing network adaptability, and improving overall system efficiency in highly dynamic and constrained environments. Such integration highlights the cross-domain applicability and transformative potential of agentic AI.

### 2.7. Gaps in Current Research and Contribution of This Paper

Despite the rapid advancements, several gaps remain in the current research on agentic architectures in AI-native software development. While frameworks are emerging, comprehensive comparative analyses focusing on their practical implications for enterprise-scale software engineering are limited. Furthermore, the critical issue of ensuring the trustworthiness and verifiability of agent-generated artifacts, especially within regulated industries, requires more dedicated investigation. This paper contributes by systematically synthesizing existing knowledge, providing a nuanced analysis of the "speed vs. trust" dilemma, and proposing a structured research roadmap. By consolidating insights from disparate studies and focusing on the architectural implications, this research aims to offer a foundational understanding for both practitioners and academics, guiding future efforts toward robust, secure, and truly AI-native software development paradigms.
