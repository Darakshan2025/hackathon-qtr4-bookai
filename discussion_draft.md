### 5.1. Interpretation of Findings in the Context of AI-Native Software Development

The findings from this systematic review underscore that agentic architectures are a cornerstone of the burgeoning AI-native software development paradigm. The transition from AI as a mere tool to AI as an autonomous, goal-oriented agent marks a fundamental shift in how software is conceived, designed, and maintained. Our analysis confirms that agentic systems significantly enhance productivity by automating routine and complex tasks, thereby freeing human developers to concentrate on innovation and strategic oversight. This redefinition of roles fosters a human-agent collaboration model where the strengths of both human creativity and AI efficiency are leveraged. The inherent modularity and adaptive nature of these architectures also point towards more resilient and dynamically reconfigurable software systems, which are crucial for addressing the increasing demands of modern digital environments.

### 5.2. Addressing the "Speed vs. Trust" Gap (Roychoudhury, 2025)

A central theme emerging from the literature is the critical "speed vs. trust" gap (Roychoudhury, 2025), which highlights the tension between the rapid code generation capabilities of AI agents and the imperative for verifiable, trustworthy software. Our findings suggest that addressing this gap requires a multi-pronged approach. Firstly, there is a clear need for advanced AI-based verification and validation (V&V) mechanisms to rigorously evaluate agent-generated code for correctness, security, and adherence to specifications. This includes developing new testing paradigms and formal methods tailored for autonomous systems. Secondly, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of agent decision-making processes is crucial, allowing human developers to understand and audit agent actions. Finally, the evolution of structured agentic software engineering (SASE) and environments like the Agent Command Environment (ACE) provides frameworks for human oversight and mentorship, ensuring that agentic autonomy is balanced with accountability and control.

### 5.3. Ethical Considerations and Societal Impact

The widespread adoption of agentic architectures in software development raises several significant ethical considerations and potential societal impacts. Issues such as algorithmic bias embedded in agent-generated code, the accountability for errors or vulnerabilities introduced by autonomous agents, and the impact on human employment in the software industry require careful attention. The potential for agents to automate sensitive tasks also necessitates robust security protocols and privacy-preserving designs to prevent misuse or data breaches. Furthermore, the increasing reliance on AI agents could lead to a degradation of human programming skills if not managed thoughtfully. Future research must proactively address these ethical dimensions, advocating for responsible AI development guidelines, regulatory frameworks, and educational initiatives to prepare the workforce for an AI-augmented future.

### 5.4. Comparison with Existing Paradigms

Comparing agentic architectures with existing software development paradigms reveals both continuities and radical departures. Traditional software engineering emphasizes detailed human planning, explicit coding, and rigorous manual testing. While agile methodologies introduced iterative development and greater flexibility, the core human-centric model persisted. Agentic architectures, in contrast, introduce a layer of autonomous decision-making and execution, fundamentally altering the role of human input. Unlike earlier forms of automation or code generation tools, modern AI agents possess a degree of intelligence and adaptability that allows them to perform complex reasoning and interact dynamically with the development environment. This paradigm shift can be seen as an extension of automation but with an added dimension of agency and learning, pushing the boundaries of what automated systems can achieve in software creation.

### 5.5. Practical Implications for Developers and Organizations

For developers, the rise of agentic architectures implies a shift from purely coding-focused roles to those involving agent orchestration, verification, and collaboration. Skills in prompt engineering, AI system design, and AI-driven V&V will become increasingly vital. Organizations, on the other hand, must prepare for significant changes in their development workflows, tooling, and talent acquisition strategies. Implementing agentic systems effectively will require investments in new infrastructure, the establishment of clear governance policies for AI-generated code, and fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation. While the initial investment may be substantial, the long-term benefits in terms of accelerated development, improved code quality, and enhanced innovation capacity are poised to deliver significant competitive advantages.
